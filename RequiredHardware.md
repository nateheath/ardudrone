# 1. Required Hardware #

  * [Parrot AR.Drone](http://ardrone.parrot.com/parrot-ar-drone/) ;) with **[Firmware 1.3.3](http://www.ardrone-flyers.com/wiki/V1.3.3)**

  * 6CH RC Radio + Receiver
> Some notes on the radio system: The mod works with a 5CH radio but a **6CH is higly recommended**! It should however **work with any RC receiver** available since we read the standard servo signal that should be equal on any reveiver no matter what. The higher the servo framerate the better! Regarding **additional input**, a programmable radio transmitter with two switches or **a switch and a button** is preferable (needed for a launch/land switch and a reset button).

  * [Molex 511100850](http://octopart.com/511100850-molex-3763204) or similar 2x4 2.00mm (.079") pitch connector (I know this one is hard to get, be creative and better get two or three of em at once! ;)

  * Cables/connectors to connect your RC Receiver to the Arduino board (this really depends on your setup)
  * Some tape or other stuff to fix the arduino and the receiver to the drone
  * Optional but recommended: shrinking tube for the cable and to protect the Arduino
